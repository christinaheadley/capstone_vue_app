    <h1>Social Reintegration after COVID</h1>
    <p>
      Isolation and distancing have been part of our lives whether we wanted to or not. Fear of infection from strangers
      isn’t just for germaphobes anymore. Like a divorcée trying a dating app, we may find our social skills are a bit
      rusty!
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of this site is to help us, wherever we may be, work towards safe and intentional social interaction.
      Humans evolved as a social species. And while some of us prefer less company, no one can do it all alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site isn't about pretty pictures. It's a place where you can build a safe community and share your fears,
      suggestions, and successes. All of you is welcome here!

      causes, a risk that may rival those of smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity.
