Social RecoverWe Social Media App and Discussion Forum

I created this project because we are social beings who needed to socially distance, and I wanted to help people be comfortable re-engaging without distance, when the time is right. 

One of my first steps in this project was to pick my tech stack and to decide what features I needed for a minimum viable product, or MVP. I reviewed the feasibility, scope, and milestones of the project. 

Using spreadsheets, I created my schema. I made tables, with sample data, of my models and their attributes and corresponding data types. I figured out what associations, join tables, and foreign keys I would need. I also made tables to determine which BE and FE RESTful and non-RESTful I would need.

I drew my wireframes on paper and made an entity-relationship diagram with LucidChart.

I stayed organized throught the project with Trello boards. I set milestones and tasks to be accomplished, and noted questions and nice-to-have features.

After the planning, the programming:
I created an API backend with Ruby on Rails. I created my models with the already determined attributes and foreign keys. I made a route, controller method, and view for each item I selected in the planning process. Next came association methods, validation, and authorization.
